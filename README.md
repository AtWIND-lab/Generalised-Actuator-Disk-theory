# Generalised-Actuator-Disk-theory

In this work, we develop a generalised actuator disk theory that extends the classical formulation by:

(i) describing how flow properties (velocity $U$, pressure $P$, and cross-sectional flow are$\sigma$) vary with the streamwise coordinate $x$, rather than limiting the analysis to far-upstream and far-downstream conditions

(ii) incorporating the effects of turbulent mixing in the wake and its contribution to wake recovery

(iii) providing physically consistent predictions of the thrust coefficient $C_T$ for a given induction factor $a$ (or vice-versa) for highly-loaded disks.
