# Generalised Actuator Disk Theory — Visualization Notebooks 

This repository accompanies the paper **“Generalised Actuator Disk Theory”** ([arXiv:2510.08213](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08213)) and provides **[Jupyter Notebooks](/JupyterNotebooks)** that reproduce **[Figure 6](/JupyterNotebooks/Figure6)** and **[Figure 8](/JupyterNotebooks/Figure8)** from the manuscript. 

---

The **generalised actuator disk theory** extends the classical formulation by:
1. Describing how flow properties — velocity ($U$), pressure ($P$), and cross-sectional area ($\sigma$) — vary with the streamwise coordinate $x$, rather than limiting the analysis to far-upstream and far-downstream conditions.  
2. Incorporating the effects of **turbulent mixing** in the wake and its contribution to wake recovery.  
3. Providing **physically consistent predictions** of the thrust coefficient ($C_T$) for a given induction factor ($a$), or vice versa, for highly loaded disks.
