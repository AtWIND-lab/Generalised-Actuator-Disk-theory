# Generalised-Actuator-Disk-theory
A generalized actuator disk theory extending the classical model by capturing streamwise variations in flow, incorporating turbulent wake mixing effects on wake recovery, and providing physically consistent predictions of thrust coefficient and induction factor for highly loaded disks.
